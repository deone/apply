Product
=======
- Make sure applicants are unable to fill an application that is not open. Check the is_open flag in both templates and views.
- Make sure applicants are unable to fill an application after specified deadline.
- Automate the creation of form templates.
- Paylater.ng is a good model for Apply Central's homepage.
- Use intercom for messaging.
- Fix formset date display format. Validates wrongly when user clicks save on the form without changing the date. Ask about modifying formset initial data on StackOverflow.
- Also ask about datepicker misbehaviour - when editing dates, if year is not selected, it uses the current year instead of whatever is set on the widget.
- Try to add queryset to forms just like formsets.
- When creating applications, staff can make mistakes. Provide a view application form link with helpful messages instead of errors. e.g ZeroDivisionError means that the staff has not created the application forms. Or better still, disable 'View Application Form' link until enough info has been provided to make it work properly.
- We can add an app_name field to Application model to explicitly specify app name instead of inferring it from Organization short name and application name.
- Think about having applicants sign in with social accounts - Google, Facebook, Twitter.
- Email applicants after account creation and after completing application form.
- Investigate projects like django-forms-builder and wagtail cms.
- Make photo dimensions a setting.
- Ensure fee is provided if has_fee is checked. This would be important when staff are able to create applications.
- There's a decorator function in django.test called modify_settings. We can use this in the test case that modifies the MEDIA_ROOT setting. There's also override_settings, this may be more appropriate.
- Make exhaustive list of all possible use cases of Apply Central, much the same way Victor thought about it.
- When you create sub-domains like ashesi.applycentral.net, also create www.ashesi.applycentral.net because people might type in 'www.'.

Urgent
======
- Ensure staff can see only completed applications. This can be a setting.
- Investigate how we were able to get an application completion above 100%.
- Use Growth Hackers font and background color.
- Implement application deadline functionality.
- Make progress area look like a widget instead of a sidebar. We can also ensure that it is always in view even when a user scrolls down that page in the case of a long page. Background should flow throughout the main area and progress should sit on the background.




Publicity Ideas
===============
- Radio
- Advertise online, starting with Facebook. Get prospects to contact us instead of trying out demo.

Strategy
========
- Talk to organizations. Get their buy-in. Sign them up.
- Do not talk to organizations. Just list their forms and publicize.
- List forms that do not require organization buy-in. e.g. Registrar-General. Be ready to do all the logistics behind this to please applicants.

Business
========
- Sell the original idea.
- Integrate Edem's idea by listing all forms that people are already processing through agents.
- We can get one of Challenges Worldwide volunteers to help with sales.
- For applications with fees, we will take a percentage of fee. For those without fees, we can make money through advertising.
- For a start, encourage organizations with application fees to incentivize applicants by reducing the fee on Apply Central.
- Start a blog.
- Create social media accounts.

Sales Tips
==========
- Sell the innovation, not the product.
- Create a market.
- Sell organizational transformation.
- Sell the possibility of building a successful business.
- Sell automation, digitization and the benefits of electronic data.
- We need to make a list of the intangible things our product will bring into our customers’ lives. e.g. relief from stress, better organizations, increased productivity, faster decision making.
- Start totally free for a number of applications in the beginning. 'Free' means we cover their payment charges for that quantity of applications. 
- Don't forget to let prospect know that you can solve all their problems with technology. Always ask about other pain points.

Proposal Changes
================
- Replace pricing information in proposal with starting free. And remove contract signing.
- Should we just mention one fee in the proposal instead of giving payment company charges info?
