Business
========
- We can get one of Challenges Worldwide voluteers to help with sales.
- For applications with fees, we can take a percentage of fee. For those without fees, we can make money through advertising.
- For a start, encourage organizations with application fees to incentivize applicants by reducing the fee on Apply Central.

Product
=======
- Make sure applicants are unable to fill an application that is not open.
- Make sure applicants are unable to fill an application after specified deadline.
- Automate the creation of form templates.
- Paylater.ng is a good model for Apply Central's homepage.
- Use intercom for messaging.
- Fix formset date display format. Validates wrongly when user clicks save on the form without changing the date. Ask about modifying formset initial data on StackOverflow.
- Also ask about datepicker misbehaviour - If year is not selected, it uses the current year instead of whatever is set on the widget.
- Don't forget to add a beautiful footer.
- Try to add queryset to forms just like formsets.
- When creating applications, staff can make mistakes. Provide a view application form link with helpful messages instead of errors. e.g ZeroDivisionError means that the staff has not created the application forms.
- Change all occurrences of 'dependence' and anything like it to 'child' for simplicity.
- Add help-text and placeholders to form fields wherever neccessary.
- Add 'Create Account' to login page. Do same for Create Account page.
- We can add an app_name field to Application model to explicitly specify app name instead of inferring it from Organization short name and application name.
- Think about having applicants sign in with social accounts - Google, Facebook, Twitter.
- Email applicants after account creation and after completing application form.
- Investigate projects like django-forms-builder and wagtail cms.
- Staff should always access the app through /orgname/admin/ for proper login and redirection. If they log in at /accounts/login/ (without the next parameter), they would be redirected to LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL (/). Do not allow this to happen.
