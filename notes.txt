- Make sure applicants are unable to fill an application that is not open.
- Make sure applicants are unable to fill an application after specified deadline.
- Update UserApplication.submit_date when user submits application.
- Automate the creation of form templates.
- Paylater.ng is a good model for Apply Central's homepage.
- Use intercom for messaging.
- Fix formset date display format. Validates wrongly when user clicks save on the form without changing the date.
- We might need to ask whether user has passport before showing passport details form.
- Add phone_numbers field to personal information form
- We need to show orphanage form only if student specifies he lives in an orphanage. We also need to keep form displayed if the form is filled. We can attach a class 'show' to orphanage form if it contains initial data and use jquery to show the form with the class name as the selector. We can also use jquery to display the form if the select field value is orphanage.
- We need to deal with the case where a formset is a dependent form. At the moment, process_form() assumes the the foreign key for all formset instances is user_application. We might need to override formset.save() to do this cleanly so that we do not set the foreign key object in setup/views.
- Ask about modifying formset initial data on StackOverflow.
- Also ask about datepicker misbehaviour - If year is not selected, it uses the current year instead of whatever is set on the widget.
- Don't forget to add a beautiful footer.
- Try to add queryset to forms just like formsets.
- When creating applications, staff can make mistakes. Provide a view application form link with helpful messages instead of errors. e.g ZeroDivisionError means that the staff has not created the application forms.
- Make deadline nullable.
- Try using expresspay payment API.
- Make course name unique.
- Change all occurrences of 'dependence' and anything like it to 'child' for simplicity.
- Add help-text and  placeholders to form fields wherever neccessary.
- Add 'Create Account' to login page. Do same for Create Account page.
- We can add an app_name field to Application model to explicitly specify app name instead of inferring it from Organization short name and application name.
